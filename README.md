# 🏗️ CONSTRUCT SECURE AI
**AI-Powered Safety Monitoring for Construction Sites**  
Real-time object detection to ensure workers are equipped with essential PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and comply with safety protocols.

---

## 📌 OVERVIEW
Construct Secure AI is a **real-time PPE detection system** built using **YOLOv8** and **Django**.  
Using a live webcam feed, it detects whether workers are wearing:

- ✅ **Safety Helmets**
- ✅ **Reflective Vests**
- ✅ **Safety Masks**
- ✅ **Safety Glasses**

The system processes live video **in real time** and allows filtering detections via a dropdown menu (helmet-only, vest-only, multiple PPE items, or all).

---

## 🚀 KEY FEATURES
- 🎯 **Multi-Class Detection** — Detect multiple PPE items in a single model.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Processing** — Works directly with webcam feed.
- 🎛 **Detection Filtering** — Choose which PPE items to monitor via dropdown.
- 💻 **Full Django Integration** — Frontend, backend, and AI model in one platform.
